              <p>Overall Theme:
                <br> Sell Out
                <br> Finally, the time has come…
                <br> You got the call.
                <br> You heard the voice mail.
                <br> You’ve made it, and all that hard work is about to pay off.
                <br> For this round, your team has been approached by Suge Beaks and he is ready to sign you and cut an album – BUT – he has conditions.
                <br> ...There’s always conditions.
                <br> In order to invest in you, you have to provide a return on that investment. Touring, merch – all that comes later… Right now we need a radio ready single and a product endorsement to get us in the door. Think you have what it takes to market yourself to the big leagues? Are you ready to do whatever it takes to make it and claim your spot on the main stage? ...are you ready to sell out?

              <p>
                Jingle is v rusty. I like it. The drop feels stylistically anchored to their round 3 submission, which I appreciate.  Welp. I definitely heavily relate to this song. I don't think anyone would be surprised that I'm really into songs that are honest about depression. The jingle is concise and effective and the BO!s are masterfully used to anchor it in the single. Sonically the single feels like something I could expect to hear at Red Rocks. The chorus feels rusty in a way that anchors it further to the jingle.

              <p>
                This jingle had me laughing so fucking hard. This is a song about Mario. The spot is fun as fuck, too. I dig the lay out the format as the joke format of songwriting. The verses feel unpolished, but some awkward auto-tune use aside the production is really great.  The hook is flawless, probably the most effective this round, even. I dig the bonus spot ending a lot.

                The jingle isn't actually a jingle, though the drop is pretty damn perfect. This is a very silly and very fun song. Again very clean production from Ohm-I. The jelly/jelly line stuck out as probably the only line of Lex's that completely misses but the rest of the song is the same quality she's consistently known for. The hook is also very solid and catchy.

              <p>
                Another commercial instead of Jingle but the backup vocals were pretty awesome. I dig how the drop sounded phoned in. Finally I dig the snares, though the beat isn't terribly engaging and the main synth is a bit annoying after a few bars. The bass drop is dope. The autotune isn't terribly effective here. This feels more like old "thanks for trying" Jollimus as far as the content and delivery goes. It's not bad so much that I'm just not interested in anything happening while I've been digging his work in earlier rounds this year much more. The Spalding line was cool.

                Again not a jingle, but rather a commercial for the team? Sort of? Sampling other teams submissions? It's cute and fun but not really what the challenge asked for. Works for the drop, though. And the more interesting element of it starts the song off. What's with the 90's video background sounds? This song sounds great. I don't see any reason this couldn't do well in radio or a playlist. The hook is very effective. The curses are very artfully smoothed out.

              <p>
                Another commercial instead of a jingle. Literally no chiptune elements. Radio drop wasn't separated from the track, but the intro felt good. Piano sample got a little grating before the end of the first verse. Drums are nice. The vocals seem to be fighting for attention with that damn piano sample. I like the hook a lot but I don't if I'd consider this a radio hit. I could see this being a good song for a live set in an dive bar. The pauses are great in the second verse and the arrogance drop in is very well done. Be sure to mention the fade.

                Again not a jingle but holy shit this is hilarious. The drop works fine. Fuck I need a video for this with plenty of wide angle shots. I don't know if I'd call this a radio ready single but I bet it'd be fun as fuck live, especially the chaotic hook. This kind of suffers from the same problem as the last song where the excessive vamping of a loud sample makes the listen a bit tiring. The outro is great.

              <p>
                Okay this is the best jingle, right? Like it's not just me? I laughed so fucking hard. There wasn't a drop in there, unless the bit that sounded like a producer tag was supposed to be it? The vocals come in a bit dry for my taste until the FLEX ON EM then I'm 10000% on board. Then it just gets better and better. I kind of wanted the verse to build a little more so the bridge was more effective but this is objectively a rad song. There's a lot of great stuff going on in this beat. I like this song.
