Clutch city chaos : this beat is solid and the raps are nice and straight forward – this is exactly what I was expecting from this round.  Hook could you some polish but it’s a shared thing – tighter delivery and a cleaner mix could have made this a solid 9.

Dangergrove : all dogs go to heaven – idk what is happening in this song. Its like avant garde rap. Like. I like it but I wouldn’t admit it. Also I have no idea what night vale was. But its good.

Dayton b and obvious lee : I forgot who this team was and I cant put my finger on it because this song is great so whoever this is good job for doing your first really good song.  Beat is fucking as fuck, love everything about this beat. The build up, break down and hook are an example of how to make a remix beat that sounds just as original as it sounds like its sample source. Gg. Raps are solid. I like it.

I have no idea : the beats are really stealing the show this round, which is weird to me bein the fandom should be easily served up for the rappers. Raps here are a good example – whats a space niggas. For real. There is a lot of context I am missing here but I googled a combination of dragon ball and space niggas and I wish I hadn’t.  gg moans – probably the catchiest hook of the comp for me

Log date : lexicohm – that first sample sounds like the voice sample from no2 from crystal method – busy child “the crystal” lol im old. This song is fucking dope.  I am starting to change my mind about this lex. I like her presentation in the vpc way more than I did on her first ep.  This beat is super minimalistic and looked up some steven universe to get a feel for both the content and beat. I get it.

Maybe next week : black to the future – this song is almost perfect in every way. Loud as fuck crash symbols? Check. Jollimus? Check. Crazy bass synths? You got it bitch. Best fandom? Fuck your own face.  These guys have an unfair advantage with me, being I am always stoked and expecting a jollisound, and they deliver… 10’s. 10’s all around. But also some attention to detail to balance a fair score… ok. The beat needs more boom in the back end, like a nice 808 on the 4s.  also this should have been a posse track.

pencil automotatiomns? – the offer : I have no idea what this fandom is and that sucks because this song is SO good. Best beat and best hook from this teams standard formula, and you would think having a formula would be a bad thing, I disagree. It works for jolly and it works for lex – I expect the pop, I expect the deep word play, I expect the vocal harmonies.  This is a great example of solo and lex playin to their strengths and nailing each pass.

Penzel waschingmachine and Donny delbito : the lustier – another great and funky use of samples – I knew this fandom straight away.  This track is a fucking crack up – the luther is a great objective focus for this type of challenge, a cool and fresh take on the fandom thing. This is my fav track of the round.  Only criticisms would be clear mixing and a little less tape effect on the beat. At v loud volumes the crackles are off putting – but I mean that’s my one complaint. It hurts too loud. Lol.

Pretty, good : kill la kill – wow the bass on this track. For a guy who works with a lot of bass, I am impressed with and really like this bass.  I don’t recognize the vocal work or sample, if it is a sample, but I am not familiar with Kill la Kill either.  That bass tho.  I would like this instrumental for every tabletop game from now until forever.  Shubs raps are in line with what we have come to expect from Shubz.  The terror of the emerald triangle, lots of quick and wait, quick and wait delivery tricks.  The fun thing about this track is that you don’t have to know the anime very well to get exactly what this track is about and where the fandom comes from. It’s a narrative type delivery that outlines the show and protagonist night and tightly.  Good offering from a solid team.

Racrownn : fantastic engeries – a standard origin story track. Nice and to the point, lots of little vocal flourishes to fill space. The delivery speed and clarity are great – one of the fastest and most consistent of the round tbh – the highs are too high and the l/r balance on this one is a little off. It might be the mix but I think we have some percs and fxs in different channels and it’s a bit distracting. Kind of a microwavable version of what could have been a restaurant quality submission.

SWA : Deadpool kills the vpc – pretty fun name drop track.  This is the type of vpc shit I feel was lost in the many iterations since the first. A callout track. Dope. The Deadpool fandom is a cool idea without an identifiable soundtrack or theme song (the ryan gosling samples help) the work for relating the material back to the fandom falls on the rapper. The chimis line does a good job of filling in the gaps tho. Fun material, GREAT drum work. Super fun track.
