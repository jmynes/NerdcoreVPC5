Clutch City Chaos
Vocalist:
Very solid. Good delivery. I really enjoyed this song.
9
Producer:
Good use of soundscape, good mixing. Something seemed a little off on the vocal mastering. It's been sounding like there is wax paper in front of Johnny's voice

Challenge:
This was a really awesome twist on the fandom challenge. You took a small portion of the show that we all would recognize and extrapolated it into a full song haha. This was just a really creative application of the challenge.

Entertaining, I'm literally laughing.

Dayton B & Obvious Lee
 
Vocalist:
You're delivery cracks me up in a good way. When you kept saying Tommy Wayne I just kept hearing "Tummy Town." Got a little sloppy in the last verse so make sure when you're recording you take breaks if you need to to reset yourself.
7
Producer:
Still issues with the mastering of your vocalist. Beat was a little repetitive. If you were using a preset filter on his voice I would avoid that filter / effect because it has been making him sound distorted each round.

Challenge:
Approached it from an unexpected angle (I'm guessing you were Alfred) creative and I enjoyed it

I have no idea
 
Vocalist:
Funny song, solid delivery. I can definitely relate to constantly being in that type of environment 
7
Producer:
This beat makes me think it's a song about "remember how the 90s were awesome!?" It was fun but it was a little repetitive. You mastered your vocalist well.
7
Challenge:
I have no idea how this takes place in the Dragon Ball universe but I laughed super hard. But unfortunately you're supposed to be taking the fandom... inserting yourself inside of it as a character, I'm not sure who you were in this so I have to dock some points.

Lexicohm
 
Vocalist:
Solid delivery, you worked blank space well and gave the beat more breathing time which is something I was actually hoping you would get the opportunity
9
Producer:
Couldn't hear Lex as clearly in my car listen but when I switched to headphones later I came back and gave you points back. But I listened on my laptop too and had a similar issue hearing her. At the danger of becoming too repetitive you do a good job at adding little elements in to switch up stuff. Next couple of rounds try to add some more variation on your instrumental beat patterns.

Challenge:
I've never seen the show but you told the story from a character's perspective. I'm going to wikipedia to verify. Ok you're good.

Maybe Next week
 
Vocalist:
Lmao you're stupid for this one. Had a couple of slippery transitions in the last verse I took off points for.

Producer:
Somehow you always find a way to compliment Jolli's ridiculousness with your instrumentals.

Lol.

Pencil Automations
 
Vocalist:
Good job with the beat riding and switch ups
9.5
Producer:
Good job, based on what the comic is about this seemed like a good fit. Not overly complicated and very ominous sounding.
9
Challenge:
Based on my expert google research it seems like this fits the challenge.

Penzel Washington And Danny DeBeato
 
Vocalist:
Fun and solid delivery.
9
Producer:
Solid beat, good vocal mixing. My only issue is that it ended up being the same loop all the way through. Usually you throw some breaks in there to give it that freshened feel part of the way through. Maybe at the portion where he was talking about the people being lined out the door around the block could have done a new sample cut there.

Challenge:
Hahahaha The Luther!! That was a good take on fandom.

Pretty, Good
 
Vocalist:
Good delivery, on the double time sections (where the high hats were doing 16th notes) it would have benefitted you do more of your double time raps - Basically Desh it up lol. You bounced between regular time and double time quite a few times which threw off the flow a little.
8
Producer:
Good build, I like the placement and variety of instruments. I am spoiled by your previous rounds though so I was wishing this instrumental was gonna be epic AF since I binge watched Kil La Kill in like 3 days.

RACrownn
 
Vocalist:
This is probably the best delivery I've heard from you this competition. You gave the instrumental space to breathe some more.
7
Producer:
Solid beat, your vocal mastering was better this round but still could use some ups. Not sure if it's the quality of what you're getting sent to you or not.

SWA
 
Vocalist:
Hahahhahaha. The hook could have used a different flavor.
8.5
Producer:
Solid beat, good vocal mixing - could have used some more variation to the beat. The hook threw me a little off in the mixing and mastering.

Challenge:
Definitely fit the challenge criteria lol. Funny way to do it too

Team ROBOKRUNK
 
Vocalist:
Desh. You better get a 10. A few slips on the quick parts.
9
Producer:
The beat was fun, there was a lot of reverb/echo on the vocals. That hook though!!!! YES. This was probably my favorite instrumental of the entire round.
