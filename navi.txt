Clutch City Chaos – Show Me What You Got
Score: 9/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (1/2)
 
There’s a lot of midrange mud in the mix, plus the vocals get buried more often than not (clashing with instruments, adlib levels, etc).
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)

Yeah, this is a solid vocal performance. Things occasionally get swallowed, and the variance between double time/halftime isn’t anything ground breaking, but it works well. The performance is energetic and confident too, and the matter-of-factness of the style works well with the POV.
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yes, the POV of the galaxy’s harshest song judges. Relatable.
 
Biopic Transcension (2/2)
 
It’s a creative use of these preexisting characters’ voice/mission! There’s acknowledgement of motivation and intent, as well as a narrative arc that doesn’t ever lean too heavily into “…and then this happened” ie: The “Get Schwifty” bridge is a cool way of progressing the narrative to the last verse without stating the action explicitly.
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
Dope re-arrangement of the main theme song. It’s got a v. appropriate pulpy hip hop-sci fi feel that feels like a logical offshoot of the show’s style.
 
Navi’s Personal Space (1/1)
 
Does it have what I need? Yes. This song is catchy regardless of the fandom. I can totally see someone digging it without knowing a damn thing about Rick and Morty. Why is that important in this case? Well, it makes sense the giant heads song would have a crowd pleasing, chant-ready chorus that ties in nicely to their catch phrase. They are the aural tastemakers of the galaxy, of course.

Dangergrove – All Dogs Go To Heaven (On Saturday)
Score: 9/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (2/2)
 
Ambitious. Diverse and varied. Well balanced. Minimal and ethereal, but it never feels empty.
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)
 
As usual, JD has a great technical grasp of the craft. The podcast vocal tone is a perfect blend of faux seriousness and humor. A lot of thought went into the vocals of this song and it shows!
 
POV (0/1)
 
Not really. The song quite openly states the POV is that of the members of Dangergrove (to amusingly credited lengths) at a radio station in the town of Danger Grove. I fucking love this song…but it doesn’t take on the POV of any character or setting in Welcome to Nightvale. It’s inspired by it, for sure, but the requirements clearly state: “write as either an existing character you love or an original character in a world you love” – not an aesthetic you love in an original world with original characters. 
 
Biopic Transcension (2/2)
 
You’ve completely nailed the progression of a Nightvale episode! The conceptual package is airtight. It lovingly pays homage to a lot of Nightvale’s tropes and themes without ever feeling like it’s just a rote retelling. There’s twists and turns and segues. All the trademark aspects of the podcast are there to the minutest detail. Tight. As. Fuck.
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
All the instrumental sections appropriately fit the Nightvale world; from the ethereal intro to the minimal, ambient beat underscoring…to the spot on fucking use of the “Weather” section’s song-within-a-song conceit. Pitch perfect.
 
Navi’s Personal Space (1/1)
 
Does it have what I need? Yes. I forgive you for breaking your lowercase title streak because this song is EXACTLY as committed to its weirdness as I need it to be.

Dayton B + Obvious Lee – Check My Resume
Score: 9.5/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (2/2)
 
The song feels slightly overcompressed, but never enough to really wear on my ears. The balance of the mix is good and there’s a lot of nice variation/drops to keep the length interesting. If I had to nitpick, there’s an awkward pop/glitch at the beginning in the cut between the classic Batman transition sample and the beat/vocal drop. Could be cleaner, but it’s not enough for me to want to really dock points for it.
 
Vocalist Prowess (1.5/2)
 
There’s the occasional awkward pacing/rhyme scheme moment that jars me out of the natural flow of the song. As always though, I love Dayton B’s vocal timbre and delivery.
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yup. Everyone’s favorite butler. Is this team stealing Children of Arkham’s shtick for the rest of the competition? Cause…I don’t mind it.
 
Biopic Transcension (2/2)
 
I know I constantly harp on braggadocio lyrics, but here’s an example of how they could be done right within the context of the challenge. Taking a character that’s otherwise a calm and stoic presence, and portraying them as the real bad ass through some solidly written wordplay is a nice flip. We also get a lot of references to Alfred’s role in the Batman saga - as well as a healthy spoonful of his personal style and motivation - to round out the specifics of the challenge.
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
Yeah, this is a driving, high-energy racetrack. It doesn’t try and invert/distort the mood of the original sample, but rather accents it with some solid instrumentation choices and sample chop work, leaning into what makes the source song so loveable. It borders on simplistic use of the source material + drums, but I never felt like it was the result of lazy choices.
 
Navi’s Personal Space (1/1)
 
Does it have what I need? Um, did Tummy Wayne die tragically in an alley? You bet. This is a banger that uses brevity and braggadocio to turn a butler into a badass. And of all the hooks in this round, there’s only one I’m huffing as I powerwalk through my night sweats: ALFRED. THADDEUS. CRANE. PENNYWORTH.

I Have No Idea - Space
Score: 6.5/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (2/2)
 
Solid work here. It could use some more polish, but nothing is glaringly unbalanced. The vocals sit well in the mix, and all the adlibs work with the main vocals, not against them. That’s rare in this competition. Also, the rhythm section of this track thumps real hard, and I love the bridge towards the end. I don’t know if the bridge deviated from the tracks’ norm enough to warrant going back to the chorus one more time at the end, but it wasn’t anything that really bothered me.
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)
 
Moans is firing on all cylinders vocally. His performance displays a tightness that I want to hear from him all the time. Rhythm and cadence are on point; there’s some strong writing and rhyming; dynamics are used to great effect; and his voice really has an emotional sincerity – which adds a nice layer to the waggish nature of the lyrics.
 
POV (0/1)
 
No. The POV is the vocalist in the real world.
 
Biopic Transcension (0/2)
 
This grading will be a bit painful for me, because I’m gonna be docking a lot of points on the challenge front. Therefore, I want to preface by saying I really, really like this song. It may be my favorite Moans track to date. It’s catchy, heartfelt, and has a high replayability value. I love the writing on the chorus. It’s simple but the rhythmic variance gives it a fun bounce that gets stuck in your head. It’s empowering, tongue-in-cheek, and geeky - everything that makes for good nerdcore music.
 
But…it eschews the challenge completely. DBZ is only referenced as an anime that exists in real life to inspire the narrator. While, this makes for some great lines -  and allows for a cool exploration of motivation and emotion – it doesn’t exist within the world of the fandom…and that’s a fundamental rule of this round.
 
Part of Your World (1.5/2)
 
Like I said above, it’s an enjoyable beat and it fits the tone and vibe of the lyrics well. The choice is to use DBZ vocal samples to fulfill the challenge, which fulfills it but isn’t necessarily the most creative way. Please correct me if this beat rearranges a DBZ original as well, but I don’t know if I get much of a sense of the fandom beyond the samples.   
 
Navi’s Personal Space (1/1)
 
Does it have the extra thing I need? Yes. It’s this team sounding like I want to hear them. Please pay more attention to the guidelines next time.

Lexicohm – Log Date
Score: 9.5/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (2/2)
 
Ohm-I continues to prove himself a deft audio engineer. The mix is well balanced, thick, and expressive. On my headphones, Lex’s vocals are a bit quiet (though, never incoherent) but on my speakers and whatnot, she sounds fine. Everything carves out its own space in the soundscape. Dope.
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)
 
The same can be said for Lex. It’s a clear, confident performance that rides the beat naturally. I was particularly struck by the little rhythm transitions she uses.
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yes. I’ll admit to not knowing Steven Universe, but I’m going to assume this is from the POV of an original character, dropped into the SUU?
 
Biopic Transcension (1.5/2)
 
I’ll admit: with fandoms I’m familiar with, I have a tendency to roll my eyes if pre-existing plot points are treated like the crux of the song. In this case? I know next to nothing about the SU storyline, so I actually quite enjoyed the way the storyline also introduced a bunch of (I assume?) actual plot/character moments. If I could nitpick one thing (Jesus, navi…), I wish everything wasn’t delivered so matter of fact.
 
This song is a, how you say, infodump. In musicals, there’s “up” songs & “out” songs; Up songs progress the plot, and “out” songs expand on the character’s emotion/motivation/abstract thoughts, etc. There’s a good amount of internal motivation gained through interaction with the other characters, and I don’t know enough about Gems in this world to know what their pre-existing internal struggles are, so I took this song as someone lonely learning why they need friends. Still, I could have used a bit more emotional “out” moments (both in the content and performance)
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
This is a banger. I’m not sure if it references/rearranges a track from SU, but there’s clear use of vocal samples so it meets the challenge. It’s menacing and slinky, which is an interesting juxtaposition to the “friends are better than no friends” message.
 
Navi’s Personal Space (1/1)
 
Does it have the extra thing I need? Yeah, sure. It’s a banger that makes me more interested in watching Steven Universe.

Maybe Next Week – Black To The Future
Score: 8.5/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (1.5/2)
 
Everything feels a bit oppressively compressed. It’s not horrible, but this song gives me ear fatigue on repeated listens. Other than that, everything sits pretty balanced. There’s some moments where adlibs clash with the main vocals.
 
Vocalist Prowess (1.5/2)
 
Lawl. “Come with this Black to the future” is a fucking hilarious flip of the phrase. I wish “1.21 niggawatts” landed harder. That first “One” always gets swallowed, so it never has as much impact as it could have as a punchline phrase in the hook.
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yes. An original character, but clearly in the world of Back To The Future. Also, apparently a canon entry to the VPC EU?
 
Biopic Transcension (2/2)
 
There is a lot of narrative description, but motivations are very, very clear. Jolli wants to take ladies on a time travelling tour. And then bed them. And they will lay with him…because they’re in a time machine…and because of the implications.
 
And also, he wants to take out Desh and Richie for some reason, because apparently there’s a bounty on their heads? See what happens when you meddle with time, kids. Loved the reference to the Twin Pines/Lone Pine as an indicator of time being fucked with.
 
Part of Your World (1.5/2)
 
There’s vocal clips used, which meets the requirements but – like I said for some of the others – doesn’t really show a creative interpretation of the producer’s challenge. IMO, producers got a bit of a softball challenge this round.
 
That said, there’s a cyberpunk industrial feel to this that works well in the context of 80s time travel fiction. I could have used more variation/dynamic shifts in the beat though.
 
Navi’s Personal Space (1/1)
 
Does it have the extra thing I need? Yes. This is peak Jolli.

Pencil Automatons – The Offer
Score: 9.5/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (2/2)
 
There’s an audio glitch in the thunderclap! Gah, I’ve listened to this 4-5 times now and it always starts me off on the wrong footing. Nice mix, though. The adlibs aren’t overwhelming or distracting, and everything sits well in the soundscape. The beat drives it all forward, and there’s some appropriately spooky instrumentation to match it. Nothing gets too cluttered. Also, how’d yall get that Solomon Grundy feature? Between this and Dayton B’s track, it seems like Children Of Arkham were the real trendsetters of VPC5. RIP. 
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)

Once again, Lex uses dynamics and melody to his advantage. I think in the case of this track it really plays to his strengths. His lazy drawl works really well on the hook, which is one of those loose rhythmic chants that gets earwormed quick. There’s some breathy issues and word swallowing at points. It’s not the perfect performance, but it’s solid.
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yes, I think. I’m at a severe disadvantage because I know absolutely nothing about this property, but it seems to pretty assuredly be from the POV of a character in the comics.
 
Biopic Transcension (1.5/2)
 
Fully embodies the internal monologue of a character, which is really cool. Lots of emotional and motivational content. It kinda plays the constant pronoun game (“me” “you”) that makes it vague enough to be relatable without alienating anyone who doesn’t know the source material. A part of me wishes there was a slightly more descriptive skew. I want to know more about the world this is from, and I barely get any of that from the lyrics. It’s not as egregious in this regard as “By A Thread” because there’s some clearer motivation towards action beyond “I fuck you up with words”, but, again, if I removed a few choice words/phrases, this could be a generic fandom song from a number of properties.
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
This falls under that category of “inspired by, without drawing on the source material” that is inevitable, it being a comic and all. Once again, I know next to nothing about the comic, but if it’s a) spooky, b) dark, and c) gothic, then this track fits as part of the world, as per the text of the challenge. Well made.

Penzel Washington + Danny DeBeato – The Luther
Score: 10/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (2/2)
 
The mix is nice and thick and everything is well balanced. Love the use of sampling in the hook. The “it’s what crack must feel like” vocals are way louder than everything else vocally, which is weird, but it’s not too distracting. This beat bounces and everything bounces with it, including my flubby belly rolls.
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)
 
Fun hook plus some hilarious lines from Ardamus. Everything flows really well and confidently. The writing is strong. I’m glad Arda earnestly embraced the guidelines of this challenge rather than approaching it with ironic detachment. It ends up working to their advantage.
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yes. Aaron McGruder’s great child revolutionary. UMD represent!
 
Biopic Transcension (2/2)
 
This is a really fun one. While it’s got a lot of narrative references from The Boondocks, it doesn’t fall too deep into the descriptive hole to feel like rote repetition of events. There’s a lot of good motivational touches that match with the Huey’s POV. The track takes a specific item from the world and builds a whole song around it, with some interesting cultural implications as well! Full success.
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
The Boondocks has a hip-hop soundtrack, which works well with this team’s aesthetic. The track could very well be on the official Boondocks OST. That being said, I wasn’t sure if this sampled something from the show or was just inspired by it. I do not hate that. It fits the lyrics well and works in the context of the challenge.

Pretty, Good – By A Thread
Score: 8.5/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (2/2)
 
Really dig the vocal processing on the sample during the hook and the big wall of sound guitars, although they’re a bit too overpowering. The mix is balanced and everything fits well together.
 
Vocalist Prowess (1.5/2)
 
When Shubz doubles down, this song works really well. When she’s rocking the minimal slower flow, it drags so much. The beat is already a slower, brooding tempo, and something in her delivery only works to compound that (in a detrimental way) when she’s not double timing or hitting quick rhythmic bounces. That being said, she’s got an emotional earnestness to her delivery that sells a lot of the lyrics, even when the pacing works against it!
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yeah, it’s not the most obvious POV on a surface level to someone not familiar with the fandom, but it’s there.
 
Biopic Transcension (1/2)
 
This is tough for me. If you took out a couple of references and word choices, this could be a generic better-than-you-at-rapping-to-the-point-of-actually-killing-you song. Again, I’ll admit to not knowing much about the fandom, but I did a quick wiki read through and checked that against the themes and content of the track. Sure, there’ s definite motivation and emotion behind it all, but this is the rare case this round where I wish there was MORE of the fandom referenced as a narrative underline.
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
Dope re-arrangement/sampling of the Kill La Kill ending theme. Again, these sort of interpretations were exactly what I was hoping for from producers this round. It flips the mood of the original and gives it a droning, lazy gait that works well for the lyrical content. Also, bold move building for over a minute before Shubz vocals come in. I think it works well as a buildup.

RACrownn – Fantastic Energies
Score: 7/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (1.5/2)
 
The sample is in the background of the beat too much. It makes the vocals/drums stand out a bit too much. I’m happy that it ends up being very clear to hear what’s being said, but I wanted that sample to thicken out things a lot more. 
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)
 
Cool performance. It’s a very apropos flow for this style of comic book rap (think MF Doom, etc). There’s some solid rhyming and a control of flow/breath that comes from seasoned writers.
 
POV (.5/1)
 
It does, kinda. Yes, the POV is an original character in a pre-existing universe, but the character is the vocalist’s rap persona. The Fantastic Four all have goofy over-the-top powers and that’s what makes their stories so much fun. According to this, the power you got is the ability to learn how to rap? Docked for lack of in-world creativity.
 
Biopic Transcension (1/2)
 
So much of this song is just a beat for beat retelling of the F4 story with the narrator shoehorned in as a character. Yeah, we get some exploration of motivation and inner monologue, but not a lot. Also, it posits as a villain origin story for the narrator, who then doesn’t become a villain? Very biopic, but also not that great at it.
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
Yeah, this is totally appropriate, almost too much so. It’s a throwback to 90s era comic rap songs, and to that extent, it doesn’t try to do anything that hasn’t already been done to death with this style. Campy vocal samples, thick drum beat, and funky orchestral choppage. Cool, but I’dda loved to hear a bit more uniqueness to the sound.

SWA – Deadpool Kills The VPC (Chimichangas)
Score: 7/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (1.5/2)
 
The vocals feel a bit naked, and the adlibs are distractingly ill balanced. It’s a decently mixed track though! I don’t know if I really like the phasy effect on some of the vocals.
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)
 
This is some solid Rafe lyricism. It reminds me of a goofy nerdcore version of 50 Cent’s How To Rob. There’s some very fun moments! Definitely one of the best Rafe raps I’ve heard. I’m not really feeling the hook though. It’s wordy without really having a solid angle to tether to. Still, nice work!
 
POV (.5/1)
 
Yes-ish. Sure, it’s Deadpool so the POV makes sense, but it’s still just gorecore rap in a rapper’s persona with Deadpool references thrown in as an anchor. It fits into the VPC EU, but ultimately it’s based in the real world, not Deadpool’s world. Some references to said world (X-men, etc) would have gone a long way.
 
Biopic Transcension (1/2)
 
It’s a very action oriented track, so we don’t get much motivation beyond japes. That’s ok, though because it’s very Deadpool. Because it’s more tongue in cheek towards other participants in the competition, rather than expanding out into the world of the fandom, I can’t give full points for challenge score.
 
 
Part of Your World (1/2)
 
The instrumental is cool, but it doesn’t really strike me as Deadpool-ish. There’s a Deadpool audio clip to clear the bare minimum of the challenge, so some points docked for lack of creativity. I’d have love to have heard some more “meta” elements in the instrumental/arrangement. I don’t know what that means offhand, but the beat could have existed more in Deadpool’s world if it played with/mocked conventions of music production/arrangement more.

Team ROBOKRUNK - Town
Score: 9.5/10
 
Mix Nitpicks (1.5/2)
 
The verse vox sound really muffled. It’s not the worst in the world, but it’s noticeable. Other than that, the beat is pretty balanced. Dope instrumental.
 
Vocalist Prowess (2/2)
 
Ya know, it’s ‘Desh. There’s the usual slew of dynamic rhythms and patterns, as well as an assured confidence in delivery. There’s some points where vox get swallowed, especially in the double time sections, but overall it’s fire. The lyrics are solid and emotional, and I like the simplicity of the hook as well.
 
POV (1/1)
 
Yeah? I’m not familiar with the source material, but a quick Wiki reveals that Desh is rapping from the POV of Shinichi, I think.
 
Biopic Transcension (2/2)
 
Totally. The ratio of motivation/emotion to narrative is strong. I get a sense of what’s happening, but I get a greater understanding of why. Desh has a way of writing internal conflict/thoughts really well, and it shows here. This is one of those fandom tracks that works well for me cause it doesn’t rely solely on knowledge of the source for listener enjoyment. 
 
Part of Your World (2/2)
 
In my research, I checked out some of Parasyte’s OST. It seems to me this is a rearrangement of HYPNOTIK? The melody lines seem to match up. If so, dope. Dope. Dope. In this round, I was really looking forward to hearing some interesting interpretations of themes from the source material (Again, I feel like producers got a bit of an easy charge this round) and this is a great way to take the song and turn it into a radio ready thumper, perfectly suited for Desh’s mood and lyrical flow.
